# Variables
- A variable is a named storage location used to hold a value. You must declare its data type when creating it (e.g., int, float, char).
- Variables only exist within the scope in which they are declared.

# Condition
Conditions allow a program to make decisions. They evaluate to true or false and control which code runs.

# Loop
- A loop repeats code until a condition is no longer met.
- Types of loops in C: while, for, do...while, and nested loops.

# Function
- Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.
- They can be built-in (from libraries) or user-defined.

# printf()
Used to print text and values to the terminal. It supports format codes to display variables.

# Format Codes
Placeholders in printf() that tell C how to display a value.
Common ones:
- %c — character
- %f — floating-point number
- %i — integer
- %li -- long integer
- %s — string
